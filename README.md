# Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website. I built it using HTML and CSS to show who I am, what I do, and some of my projects.

## What you'll find here

- A homepage with my name and a short introduction
- An "About Me" section with a brief description
- A list of my skills
- Some of my personal or academic projects
- A simple contact section

## Technologies used

- HTML5
- CSS (including Flexbox and Grid for layout)
- Media queries to make it responsive

## Design

I kept the design clean and simple, using soft colors and readable fonts. It works on different screen sizes like phones, tablets, and computers.

## What I learned

While building this portfolio, I practiced:
- Organizing code using semantic HTML
- Using Flexbox and Grid for layout
- Making websites responsive with media queries
- Writing cleaner and more understandable CSS

## Next steps

I want to keep improving this project by:
- Adding some animations
- Connecting a working contact form
- Showing more projects as I build them
